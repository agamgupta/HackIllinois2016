# HackIllinois2016

HackIllinois 2016 submission. Over the course of 36 hours we created an AR system with the Oculus Rift, a Node.js backend, and a ton of APIs to enable anyone in the world to communicate with each other in real time (no dictionary or phones necessary).

These files contain the node backend and jQuery/Bootstrap frontend. Only thing missing are the Unity project files.
